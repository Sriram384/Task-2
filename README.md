*Short Description*

1) I designed a low-fidelity wireframe in Figma outlining the complete user flow for a food delivery app â€” from restaurant discovery to order confirmation. 

2) The information architecture was structured to ensure smooth navigation and intuitive interactions across all four screens: Home, Menu, Cart/Checkout, and Order Confirmation.

3) I focused on clarity, usability, and flow consistency, mapping each step to guide users seamlessly through the ordering process before moving into high-fidelity design stages.
